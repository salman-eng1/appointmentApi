 * A raw Channel can be acquired from your Connection, but please consider
 * using a higher level abstraction like a {@link Consumer} or
 * {@link Publisher} for most cases.
 *
 * AMQP is a multi-channelled protocol. Channels provide a way to multiplex a
 * heavyweight TCP/IP connection into several light weight connections. This
 * makes the protocol more “firewall friendly” since port usage is predictable.
 * It also means that traffic shaping and other network QoS features can be
 * easily employed. Channels are independent of each other and can perform
 * different functions simultaneously with other channels, the available
 * bandwidth being shared between the concurrent activities.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * const rabbit = new Connection()
 *
 * // Will wait for the connection to establish and then create a Channel
 * const ch = await rabbit.acquire()
 *
 * // Channels can emit some events too (see documentation)
 * ch.on('close', () => {
 *   console.log('channel was closed')
 * })
 *
 * // Create a queue for the duration of this connection
 * await ch.queueDeclare({queue: 'my-queue'})
 *
 * // Enable publisher acknowledgements
 * await ch.confirmSelect()
 *
 * const data = {title: 'just some object'}
 *
 * // Resolves when the data has been flushed through the socket or if
 * // ch.confirmSelect() was called: will wait for an acknowledgement
 * await ch.basicPublish({routingKey: 'my-queue'}, data)
 *
 * const msg = ch.basicGet('my-queue')
 * console.log(msg)
 *
 * await ch.queueDelete('my-queue')
 *
 * // It's your responsibility to close any acquired channels
 * await ch.close()
 * ```
